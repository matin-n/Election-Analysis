# Election Analysis

## Project Overview
### Purpose
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has been given the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election. The purpose of this audit is to analyze the candidates and counties:

#### Candidate
- Calculate the total votes in the election
- Calculate each candidate's total vote and percentage of votes
- Determine the winner of the election, winning vote count, and winning percentage of votes

#### County
- Determine each county and its total vote county
- Calculate each county's percentage of total votes
- Determine the county with the most substantial number of voters

## Election Audit Results
The analysis shows that:
- There were 369,711 votes cast in the election.
- The counties results:
  - Jefferson
    - Received 10.5% of the votes and 38,855 votes
  - Denver
    - Received 82.8% of the votes and 306,055 votes
  - Arapahoe
    - Received 6.7% of the votes and 24,801 votes
- The largest county turnout rate:
    - Denver, who acquired 82.% of the votes and 306,055 number of votes
- The candidates results:
  - Charles Casper Stockham
    -  Received 23.0% of the votes and 85,213 votes
  - Diana DeGette
    - Received 73.8% of the votes and 272,892 votes
  - Raymon Anthony Doane
    - Received 3.1% of the votes and 11,606 votes
- The winner of the election was:
  - Diana DeGette, who acquired 73.8% of the votes and 272,892 number of votes

## Summary

I propose that this script gets modified for the election commission to be used for any election. One solution is to remove the hardcoded variable of `file_to_load = os.path.join("Resources", "election_results.csv")` to a dynamic input given by the user. A snippet of code that used for removing the hardcoded filename is:

```Python
# Add a variable to load a file from a path.
election_file = input("What is the file name of file that contains the election results? (ex. election_results.csv)\n")
file_to_load = os.path.join("Resources", election_file)

# Ask user for input again if file does not exist
while not os.path.isfile(os.path.join("Resources", election_file)):
    print("ERROR!", "File not found. Check to see if the file exists.")
    election_file = input("What is the file name of file that contains the election results? (ex. election_results.csv) \n")
```


The second proposal is to conduct further analysis by analyzing supplemental data, such as the election results of each year. For example, we could modify the `election_results.csv` to include the election results of each year as a new column and have the script read the new columns. The yearly data can be achieved by making the script read multiple CSV files and then merge the dataset into a single CSV file or conduct the analysis in memory without writing to a new column. We could then conduct additional analysis for each year and compare the results. Resources to achieve this task can be found with [Pandas library](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/merging.html) or [files.write()](https://www.kite.com/python/answers/how-to-concatenate-two-csv-files-in-python).
